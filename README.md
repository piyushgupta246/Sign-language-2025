## üîç About

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi and is a leading cause of death among children and the elderly worldwide.

Early diagnosis is critical to effective treatment, but interpreting chest X-rays can be challenging, especially in areas with limited access to skilled radiologists. This project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automate and improve the accuracy of pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images.
